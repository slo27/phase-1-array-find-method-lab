// Write a function called superbowlWin() in index.js:

// The function should receive 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects

// Each object has two properties: year and result

// It should use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!

// It should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!)

// If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined
